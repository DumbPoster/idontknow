to add this to livley follow these steps

either download all 7 files and put them in a folder
or download the zip file and unzip it

take that folder and move it to in my case C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Local\Packages\12030rocksdanister.LivelyWallpaper_97hta09mmv6hy\LocalCache\Local\Lively Wallpaper\Library\wallpapers
and then open up the livley app and it should be there
